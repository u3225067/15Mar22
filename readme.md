# Project 1: Responsive Website
## refelction of creation

This is my reflection on the process of creating a website using html and CSS. Although I have never created a website before I found this subject interesting and rewarding. I learned that website construction requires a process to ensure your project comes together.
My website process started with creating the navigation or bones of my website. During the period of creation, I laid out how each part is going to link to the next page and ensured that each page had the required information on it (refer to navigation map attached). Once I had my drawings of the navigation of my site, I then started working out the pages and images. My website although is basic, has a lot of hours working out different codes to flex, move and align-items on the pages. Understanding how to write the code I found to be the most challenging and interesting part of the process. I could spend thirty minutes trying to understand why it is not working and ultimately discover the code was only one letter out from the styles sheet. Although this was frustrating the bigger picture is understanding attention to detail within the code.
Using online tutorials allowed me to not only learn but expand my code knowledge to understand the patterns within the code. I tried to understand the code rather than just copy and paste and through this method I found that it became easier to understand the process. 
To critically analyse my website, things I could do to improve from here would be: to ensure the splash page was able to switch to index page, have links to Twitter, Instagram and Facebook pages, making the website more responsive and more focused on the new up and coming trends. Things I believes I have done well include: having a functioning website, the layout, the navigational system and the image display.
